                <p>
                    How do volunteers help people with disabilities? They can help with the organization of leisure and recreation, engage in art therapy with their ward, teach something, talk about something, read a book, teach how to use a modern telephone. Volunteers can help with cleaning, caring for bedridden patients, or just sit with a person with a disability while his relatives decide some of their own business. Volunteers can take a dog for a walk, help someone in a wheelchair down the stairs… There are so many different, most simple things in which the help of a caring person is invaluable!

                <h3>What are the benefits of volunteers?</h3>
                <p>
                    Our company will financially provide all those who help, and give certificates for the portfolio. This will help volunteers in building their future, getting into a good university, or finding a prestigious job with a well-paid salary.
